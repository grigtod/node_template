Alternatively you can run the start.bat file which will both install all dependencies and start a local server. You can then find your website at: http://localhost:3000/

----------------
You can access the website on other devices on the same network by accessing: [Your IP]:3000

To find your IP you can use 'ipconfig' in the command prompt. Running the start.bat file will also list your IP address. Use the local one that starts with 192 and make sure to add the port (:3000) afterwards.
